# Matlab Madrigal API

Patched Madrigal Matlab client for current Matlab versions.

[Madrigal Matlab remote API 2.4.5](http://madrigal.haystack.mit.edu/madrigal/distributionFiles/)
is from 2019, and doesn't work properly with current Matlab versions.
I patched the essential functions e.g. "globalIsprint" to work until / if Madrigal Matlab API is once again maintained upstream.
